This Arduino sketch was the one that I used to make the project demonstrated
in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z840N9P-T2k) video.
It is about a keyboard controller that I've made using an old Alesis QS6 Keyboard
directly connected to an Arduino Mega rev3 acting as keyboard scanner with 
velocity reading and sustain pedal support.
