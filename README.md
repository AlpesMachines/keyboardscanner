This Arduino sketch was the one that I used to make the project demonstrated
in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z840N9P-T2k) video.
It is about a keyboard controller that I've made using an old Alesis QS6 Keyboard
directly connected to an Arduino Mega rev3 acting as keyboard scanner with 
velocity reading and sustain pedal support.

At 2017 did the same with another keyboard (a Casio from a friend). The code was refactored.
